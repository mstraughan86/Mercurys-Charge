[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ggauravr/slack-terminalize.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ggauravr/slack-terminalize) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ggauravr/slack-terminalize/badge.svg?branch=develop&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/ggauravr/slack-terminalize?branch=develop)

---
Helps build a command-line system in Slack, to create a custom vocabulary for your bot.

---
## Motivation

This module was built to abstract away some of the basic tasks of massaging a message posted on Slack channel, before giving it to the bot.
That said, this is an opinionated implementation, because it's as it is, limits to building a linux shell-like environment, where the first word
of the message is considered the command and the words that follow, the arguments. More in the code example section below.

---
## Usage

```javascript

var slackTerminal = require('slack-terminalize');

slackTerminal.init({
	SLACK_TOKEN: '<your-slack-token-here>'
});

```
